  <p>As I, Dr. Oliver, was rereading my accounts of past cases, I have never, NEVER read one quite as suspenseful or exciting as this:</p>

<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>

<p>One day, when Holmes and I were discussing how we might get ourselves a job, the housemaid came in:</p>
<p>	“Mr. Fullam wants to see you,” she said.</p>
<p>	“Let him in,” responded Holmes.</p>

<p>	“When?” asked Holmes.</p>
